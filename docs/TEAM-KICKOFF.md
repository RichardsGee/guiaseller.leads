## 1️⃣ Project Overview (10 min)

### What Are We Building?

**guiaseller.leads** is an **internal lead intelligence platform** for GuiaSeller's admin team.

**In Simple Terms:**
- 📊 Dashboard to view all marketplace leads (ML, Shopee, Magalu, TikTok, Amazon, Shein)
- 🎯 Auto-scoring system (0-100) to identify high-value leads
- 📈 Real-time analytics to track conversion rates
- 🤖 AI-powered recommendations (Phase 2)

### Current Problem (What Admins Say)

> "We get 50K+ leads/day from 6 marketplaces, but we have NO WAY to prioritize them. Every lead takes 15 minutes to assess manually. We're missing high-value opportunities." — Carlos, Lead Manager

> "We have no historical data on conversion patterns. It's all manual reporting." — Beatriz, Business Analyst

> "I can't see team performance metrics in real-time." — Roberto, Director

### Our Solution

**Dashboard = Intelligence**
- Auto-score every lead
- Filter by marketplace, score, segment
- See real-time conversion metrics
- Get AI recommendations (later)

**Impact:**
- Conversion rate: 12% → 18% (+50%)
- Lead processing time: 15min → 7min (50% faster)
- Admin satisfaction: > 4.5/5

---

## 2️⃣ Why It Matters (5 min)

### Business Context

**GuiaSeller is growing:**
- 50K+ daily leads (and increasing)
- 6 marketplace sources
- Manual processes can't scale
- Need data-driven decision making

**This project enables:**
- ✅ Better lead prioritization
- ✅ Faster conversion cycles
- ✅ Data-driven insights
- ✅ Foundation for AI features (Phase 2)
- ✅ Competitive advantage (vs generic tools)

### Strategic Value

This is **Phase 1 of 3-phase product:**
- Phase 1 (now): Internal tool (MVP)
- Phase 2 (Q2): AI personalization (ML scoring)
- Phase 3 (2027): B2B offering (white-label for sellers)

## 7️⃣ Q&A (5 min)

### Common Questions

**Q: What if we don't finish Wave 1 on time?**
A: Wave 1 is blocking (DB, Auth). If delayed, Wave 2 starts late but same quality bar. We escalate immediately.

**Q: Can we cut scope to go faster?**
A: MVP scope is locked (PRD). We optimize execution instead (code reuse, automation, parallelization).

**Q: What about the AI features?**
A: Phase 2 (6 weeks). MVP is rule-based scoring only. Phase 2 adds ML model.

**Q: How do we handle prod issues during launch?**
A: On-call rotation (24/7 first week). Rollback plan for critical bugs. Documented escalation path.

**Q: What if testing takes longer?**
A: Wave 3 has buffer (W6-W7). We prioritize critical path tests first (API, real-time sync).
